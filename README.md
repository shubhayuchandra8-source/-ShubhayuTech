Passionate about learning Python and Data Science.

Hey there! 👋



I'm Shubhayu, a Computer Science student specializing in Data Science.

I enjoy learning by building and experimenting with code.

If a concept interests me, I try to implement it in Python and understand it deeply through practice.

My current focus is on Python, data analysis, and machine learning fundamentals.  

I enjoy working with libraries like NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, and I’m gradually improving my problem-solving skills.

Most of my repositories are learning-based projects, practice programs, and academic work — each one helping me grow step by step.

I’m actively learning, improving, and preparing for internships and real-world challenges.
